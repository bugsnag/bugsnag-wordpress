Bugsnag is a WordPress plugin that automatically detects errors & crashes on your WordPress site, and notifies you by email, chat or issues system


== Description ==

Bugsnag is a WordPress plugin that automatically detects errors & crashes on your WordPress site, and notifies you by email, chat or ticket system.

All websites crash from time to time, including WordPress sites! The *WordPress Error Monitoring* plugin by Bugsnag automatically detects crashes, exceptions and other errors in your WordPress PHP code as well as any errors in plugins you are using.

Errors are sent to your [Bugsnag Dashboard](https://bugsnag.com) for you to view and debug, and we'll also notify you by email, chat, sms or create a ticket in your issue tracking system if you use one. We'll also show you exactly how many times each error occurred, and how many users were impacted by each crash.


== Installation ==

Bugsnag is available through the [WordPress Plugins Directory](http://wordpress.org/plugins/), so you can download and install automatically from the Plugins menu on your WordPress admin page.

To manually install Bugsnag:

1. Unzip `bugsnag-wordpress.zip`
1. Upload the `bugsnag` directory from the zip file to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
